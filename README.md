Shule is a simple front-end interface for your WebShule server. At its heart, Shule provides a minimalistic web-based application that allows users to:

  * Signup/Login with Google, Office365, OpenID Connect, or through the application itself.
  * Manage your account settings and user preferences.
  * Create and manage your own personal rooms ([](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) sessions).
  * Invite others to your room using a simple URL.
  * View recordings and share them with others.

Interested? Try Shule out on our [demo server](https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl)!

Shule is also completely configurable. This means you can turn on/off features to make Shule fit your specific use case. For more information on Shule and its features, see our [documentation](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-install.html).

## Installation on a WebShule Server

Shule is designed to work on a [WebShule 2.0](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) (or later) server.

For information on installing Shule, checkout our [Installing Shule on a WebShule Server](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-install.html#installing-on-a-bigbluebutton-server) documentation.

## Source Code & Contributing

Shule is built using Ruby on Rails. Many developers already know Rails well, and we wanted to create both a full front-end to WebShule but also a reference implementation of how to fully leverage the [ API](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/api.html).

We invite you to build upon Shule and help make it better. See [Contributing to WebShule](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/support/faq.html#contributing-to-bigbluebutton).

We invite your feedback, questions, and suggests about Shule too. Please post them to the [ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-greenlight).
