Greenlight is a simple front-end interface for your BigBlueButton server. At its heart, Greenlight provides a minimalistic web-based application that allows users to:

  * Signup/Login with Google, Office365, or through the application itself.
  * Manage your account settings and user preferences.
  * Create and manage your own personal rooms ([BigBlueButton](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) sessions).
  * Invite others to your room using a simple URL.
  * View recordings and share them with others.

Interested? Try Greenlight out on our [demo server](https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl)!

Greenlight is also completely configurable. This means you can turn on/off features to make Greenlight fit your specific use case. For more information on Greenlight and its features, see our [documentation](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-install.html).

## Installation on a BigBlueButton Server

Greenlight is designed to work on a [BigBlueButton 2.0](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) (or later) server.

For information on installing Greenlight, checkout our [Installing Greenlight on a BigBlueButton Server](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-install.html#installing-on-a-bigbluebutton-server) documentation.

## Source Code & Contributing

Greenlight is built using Ruby on Rails. Many developers already know Rails well, and we wanted to create both a full front-end to BigBlueButton but also a reference implementation of how to fully leverage the [BigBlueButton API](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/api.html).

We invite you to build upon Greenlight and help make it better. See [Contributing to BigBlueButton](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/support/faq.html#contributing-to-bigbluebutton).

We invite your feedback, questions, and suggests about Greenlight too. Please post them to the [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-dev).
