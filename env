# If "true", GreenLight will register a webhook callback for each meeting
# created. This callback is called for all events that happen in the meeting,
# including the processing of its recording. These events are used to update
# the web page dynamically as things happen in the server.
# If not "true", the application will add a metadata to the meetings with this same
# callback URL. Scripts can then be added to BigBlueButton to call this callback
# URL and send specific events to GreenLight (e.g. a post publish script to warn
# the application when recordings are done).
GREENLIGHT_USE_WEBHOOKS=false

# Slack Integration (optional)
#
#   You will need to register an incoming-webhook for your slack channel
