## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think youâ€™ve found a security issue with BigBlueButton or Greenlight, we ask that you do a [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) and e-mail us directly at security@bigbluebutton.org.

We will respond to you quickly, work with you to examine the scope of the issue, and give priority to fixing it as soon as possible.
