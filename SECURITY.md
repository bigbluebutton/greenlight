# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support Greenlight through the community forums and through security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------| ------------------ |
| v1.x    | :x:                |
| v2.x    | :white_check_mark: |
| v3.x    | :white_check_mark: |
| > v3.x  | :x:                |

Since we released v3 to the community all our support efforts are now transitioned to the subsequent releases v3.x.

All the releases are managed as a Cloud version where release tags are used only as a reference. As such, we highly recommend that all administrators deploy the latest available release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in BigBlueButton or Greenlight, we ask that you do a [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) and e-mail us directly at `security@bigbluebutton.org` with as much detail as possible.

We will respond to you quickly, work with you to examine the scope of the issue, and give priority to fixing it as soon as possible.

Regards,... BigBlueButton Team
